DNS Entry For Route Should Resolve
    [Documentation]    Resolve the name for a route via mDNS from the hypervisor/RF runner.
    ...    Expects RF runner host has opened port 5353 for libvirt zone.

    ${result}=    Run Process

    ...    timeout=15s
    Log Many    ${result.stdout}    ${result.stderr}

    # avahi-resolve-host-name always returns rc=0, even if it failed to resolve.
    # In case of failure, stdout will be empty and stderr will contain error.
    # Expected success stdout:
    # > hello-microshift.cluster.local 192.168.124.5
    # Possible stderr:
    # > Failed to resolve host name 'hello-microshift.cluster.local': Timeout reached
